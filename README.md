What if there was a stronger variant of Netherite but from the end? Well this mod shows you what it would be like.

Keep in mind that already generated terrain/chunks will NOT contain enderite since the mod does not edit pre-existing chunks, to find enderite you would need to explore until you find new chunks or make a new world.

 

Works for both client and server with the same .jar

Data
To make enderite put a netherite item on a smithing table with an enderite ingot.
to make an enderite ingot put 4 enderite scraps and 4 diamonds in a crafting table.
By default full enderite set gives you resistance 1, this can be disabled on the mod config file.
